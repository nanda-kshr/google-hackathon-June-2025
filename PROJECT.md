# Troll Video Creator Project

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Troll Video Creator came from the growing popularity of reaction videos and meme culture on social media platforms. We noticed that creating engaging reaction videos often requires significant manual effort in timing and clip selection. We wanted to automate this process using AI to make it more accessible and efficient for content creators. The project aims to combine the power of AI with video editing to create entertaining content that resonates with modern social media audiences.

## What it does

Troll Video Creator is an AI-powered video editing tool that:
- Takes an input video and automatically analyzes its content
- Transcribes speech and identifies emotional contexts
- Intelligently inserts pre-recorded troll/reaction clips at appropriate moments
- Maintains video quality and synchronization
- Generates a summary of the final video with statistics
- Creates a seamless, entertaining output video that combines the original content with comedic reactions

The tool uses Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API for accurate transcription and Gemini AI for intelligent clip selection, making it capable of understanding context and sentiment to place reactions naturally.
